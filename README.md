Football Picks
==============

 - Login with Facebook
 - Create a season (using cURL, ATM)
 - send invite links to people, clicking lets them join
 - make and update your picks until the week is closed (partial is ok)
 - for upcoming weeks, submited picks show as `0`, no picks shows as `-`
 - the admin must close weeks and submit the winners
 
still need to figure out:
 - creating a season without cURL ?
 - multiple seasons! (data model is there, needs ui for switching and view permissions)
 - sticky headers on the score tables

bugs:
 - guess what? the schedule can change during the season ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Don't laugh at my client-side code (⊙﹏⊙✿)
